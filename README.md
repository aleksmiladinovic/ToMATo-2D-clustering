We will demonstrate the work of ToMATo (Topological Mode Analysis Tool) algorithm for clustering data.
Firstly, we will consider the estimated density function on the data. The mode detection is done via the graph-based hill-climbing scheme.
The novelty of this approach lies in the use of topological persistence for determining the importance of the modes, forming the hierarchy of the modes as well as the merging of the clusters based on this information.
Additionally, this algorithm offers visualisation of the data, most notably in the form of persistence diagrams which depict the importance of the modes of estimated density function.
This information allows us to choose the parameter values based on which the algorithm will give us the exact number of clusters.
